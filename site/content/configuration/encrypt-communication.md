## Overview

Follow the steps in this guide to encrypt communication between NGINX Agent and Instance Manager with TLS.

## Before You Begin

To enable mTLS, you must have TLS enabled and supply a key, cert, and a CA cert on both the client and server. TSee the [Secure Traffic with Certificates](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/admin-guides/configuration/secure-traffic/) topic for instructions on how to generate keys and set them in the specific values in the NGINX Agent configuration.

## Enabling mTLS

See the examples below for how to set these values using a configuration file, CLI flags, or environment variables.

### Enabling mTLS via Config Values

You can edit the `/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf` file to enable mTLS for NGINX Agent. Make the following changes:

```yaml
server:
  metrics: "cert-sni-name"
  command: "cert-sni-name"
tls:
  enable: true
  cert: "path-to-cert"
  key: "path-to-key"
  ca: "path-to-ca-cert"
  skip_verify: false
```

The `cert-sni-name` value should match the SubjectAltName of the server certificate. For more information see [Configuring HTTPS servers](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).

### Enabling mTLS with CLI Flags

To enable mTLS for the NGINX Agent from the command line, run the following command:

```bash
nginx-agent --tls-cert "path-to-cert" --tls-key "path-to-key" --tls-ca "path-to-ca-cert" --tls-enable
```

### Enabling mTLS with Environment Variables

To enable mTLS for NGINX Agent using environment variables, run the following commands:

```bash
NMS_TLS_CA="my-env-ca"
NMS_TLS_KEY="my-env-key"
NMS_TLS_CERT="my-env-cert"
NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true
```

## Enabling Server-Side TLS

To enable server-side TLS you must have TLS enabled. See the following examples for how to set these values using a configuration file, CLI flags, or environment variables.

### Enabling Server-Side TLS via Config Values

You can edit the `/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf` file to enable server-side TLS. Make the following changes:

```bash
tls:
  enable: true
  skip_verify: false
```

### Enabling Server Side TLS with CLI Flags

To enable server-side TLS from the command line, run the following command:

```bash
nginx-agent --tls-enable
```

### Enabling Server-Side TLS with Environment Variables

To enable server-side TLS using environment variables, run the following commands:

```bash
NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true
```

## Enable Server-Side TLS With Self-Signed Certificate

{{< warning >}}These steps are not recommended for production environments.{{< /warning >}}

To enable server-side TLS with a self-signed certificate, you must have TLS enabled and set `skip_verify` to `true`, which disables hostname validation. Setting `skip_verify` can be done done only by updating the configuration file. See the following example:

```bash
tls:
  enable: true
  skip_verify: true
```

## Insecure Mode (Not Recommended)

To enable insecure mode, you simply need to set `tls:enable` to `false`. Setting this value to `false` can be done only by updating the configuration file or with environment variables. See the following examples:

### Enabling Insecure Mode via Config Values**

You can edit the `/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf` file to enable insecure mode. Make the following changes:

```bash
tls:
  enable: false
```

### Enabling Insecure Mode with Environment Variables**

To enable insecure mode using environment variables, run the following commands:

```bash
NMS_TLS_ENABLE=false
```

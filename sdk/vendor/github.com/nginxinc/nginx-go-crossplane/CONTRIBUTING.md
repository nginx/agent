### Open a Pull Request

* Fork the repo, create a branch, implement your changes, add any relevant tests, submit a PR when your changes are **tested** and ready for review.
* Fill in [our pull request template](https://github.com/{{REPOSITORY_OWNER}}/{{REPOSITORY_URL}}/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).

Note: if you'd like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Code Guidelines

<!-- ### Go/Python/Bash Guidelines (OPTIONAL) -->

### Git Guidelines

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch (within reason), rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR.
* If possible and/or relevant, use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when writing a commit message, so that changelogs can be automatically generated
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/> and summarised in the next few points:
  * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
  * Limit the subject line to 67 characters or less.
  * Limit the rest of the commit message to 72 characters or less.
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line.
  * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`).

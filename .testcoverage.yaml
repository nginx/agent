# Holds regexp rules which will override thresholds for matched files or packages using their paths.

# First rule from this list that matches file or package is going to apply new threshold to it.
# If project has multiple rules that match same path, override rules should be listed in order from
# specific to more general rules.

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - \.pb\.go$       # Excludes all protobuf generated files
    - \.gen\.go       # Excludes generated files
    - ^fake_.*\.go    # Excludes fakes
    - ^test/.*$
    - app.go          # app.go and main.go should be tested by integration tests.
    - main.go
    - internal/datasource/config # These need to be addressed
    - internal/datasource/host # These need to be addressed

    - internal/plugin # These need to be addressed

# NOTES:
# - symbol `/` in all path regexps will be replaced by

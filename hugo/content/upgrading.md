## Upgrade the NGINX Agent

To upgrade the NGINX Agent, take the following steps:

1. Open an SSH connection to the server where youâ€™ve installed the NGINX Agent and log in.

1. Make a backup copy of the following locations to ensure that you can successfully recover if the upgrade has issues:

    - `/etc/nginx-agent`
    - `config_dirs` values for any configuration specified in `/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf`

1. Stop the NGINX Agent:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl stop nginx-agent
    ```

1. Install the updated version of the NGINX Agent:

    - CentOS, RHEL, RPM-Based

        ```shell
        sudo yum -y makecache
        sudo yum update -y nginx-agent
        ```

    - Debian, Ubuntu, Deb-Based

        ```shell
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y --only-upgrade nginx-agent -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold"
        ```

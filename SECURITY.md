# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We advise users to run the most recent release and/or stable commit of the NGINX Agent, and we issue software updates to the most recent release. We provide technical support for F5 customers who are using the most recent version of the NGINX Agent, and any version released within two years of the current release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The F5 Security Incident Response Team (F5 SIRT) has an email alias that makes it easy to report potential security vulnerabilities.

## Why

While there are other tool out there that will create a changelog output as part
of their workflow none of the ones I could find did so in a way that allowed
formatting the output via multiple templates.

The need to multiple output formats was being driven by the desire to add
changelog support to https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm and the deb and rpm
changelog formats not being the same.

## Goals

* [x] be simple to use
* [x] provide decent default templates for deb, rpm, release and repository
  style changelog formats
* [x] be distributed as a single binary
* [x] reproducible results
  * [x] depend on the fewer external things as possible
  * [x] store changelog in a transportable format (.yml)
* [x] be possible to use it as a lib in other go projects (namely
  [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com) itself)

## Install
`go get github.com/goreleaser/chglog/cmd/chglog`

## Usage

The first steps are to run `chglog config` to initialize a config file
(`.chglog.yml`) and edit the generated file according to your needs:

```yaml
conventional-commits: false
deb:
  distribution: []
  urgency: ""
debug: false
owner: ""
package-name: ""

```

The next step is to run `chglog init`.
```yaml
- semver: 0.0.1
  date: 2019-10-18T16:05:33-07:00
  packager: dj gilcrease <example@example.com>
  changes:
  - commit: 2c499787328348f09ae1e8f03757c6483b9a938a
    note: |-
      oops i forgot to use Conventional Commits style message

      This should NOT break anything even if I am asking to build the changelog using Conventional Commits style message
  - commit: 3ec1e9a60d07cc060cee727c97ffc8aac5713943
    note: |-
      feat: added file two feature

      BREAKING CHANGE: this is a backwards incompatible change
  - commit: 2cc00abc77d401a541d18c26e5c7fbef1effd3ed
    note: |-
      feat: added the fileone feature

      * This is a test repo
      * so ya!
```

Then to generate a `CHANGELOG.md` file you would do `chglog format --template
repo > CHANGELOG.md`

Now whenever you goto do another release you would do `chglog add --version
v#.#.#` (version MUST be semver format)

And that's it!


## Usage as lib

You can look at the code of chglog itself to see how to use it as a library
